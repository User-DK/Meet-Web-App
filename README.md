# Peer-to-Peer Meeting App using WebRTC

## Overview

In a peer-to-peer meeting scenario, each participant's device has both logical and physical addresses on the internet. While WebRTC handles the real-time communication aspect, a backend infrastructure with sockets is necessary to establish the initial connection between peers.

## Features

- **WebRTC Integration:** Utilizes the power of WebRTC for seamless real-time communication.
- **Peer-to-Peer Connectivity:** Establishes direct connections between devices for efficient and secure meetings.
- **Backend Socket Implementation:** The backend of the application is equipped with sockets to facilitate the initial connection setup between peers.
